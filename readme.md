Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years.

Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.
